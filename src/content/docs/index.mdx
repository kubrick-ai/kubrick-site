## The Problem

Hours of video content sitting in archives, unsearchable except by filename or manual tagging. Finding specific moments, topics, or discussions across your video library becomes a time-consuming manual process.

## The Solution

Transform any video into a searchable knowledge base using AI-powered semantic understanding. Kubrick enables you to search by concepts, not just keywords - find "quarterly goals discussion" even if those exact words were never spoken.
