Kubrick lets you search video using natural language, images, audio, or other
video clips, returning the exact moments that are most relevant.

As video libraries grow across domains like sports, education, security, and
marketing, finding a specific moment becomes tedious. Scrubbing through
timelines, relying on inconsistent tags, or remembering file names is slow and
often frustrating.

Building a system that can understand video content is complex. It requires
processing large files, extracting multimodal features, storing and indexing
them efficiently, and serving fast search results, all while integrating into
existing infrastructure.

Kubrick solves this by providing an open-source end-to-end ingestion pipeline
and API for video semantic search. The pipeline automatically generates vector
embeddings from ingested video and stores them in a vector database. The API
allows users to search the database and interact with the pipeline. Its modular,
serverless architecture can be deployed directly into an AWS environment, giving
teams full ownership of their data while remaining flexible enough to integrate
new embedding models in the future.
