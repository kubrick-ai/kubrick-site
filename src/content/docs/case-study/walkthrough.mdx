## Deployment

Kubrick includes a CLI tool that automates the process of setting up and
deploying the infrastructure, meaning developers can have an ingestion pipeline
up and running in a matter of minutes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubrick-ai/kubrick.git
cd kubrick/cli && npm run build
kubrick deploy
```

<Image src={cliDemoDeploy} alt='CLI Deployment Demo' width={800} height={800} />

Full CLI deployment documentation is available [here](/guides/quick-start).

## API

Deploying the infrastructure will expose the Kubrick API:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label='bash'>

```bash
curl -X POST https://API_URL/v1_0/search
-H Content-Type: multipart/form-data \
-F query_type=text \
-F query_text="A red sports car driving down the highway" \
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label='js'>

```js
const url = "https://API_URL/v1_0/search";
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("query_type", "text");
formData.append("query_text", "A red sports car driving down the highway");

const response = await fetch(url, { method: "POST", body: formData });
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label='python'>

```py
import requests

url = "https://API_URL/v1_0/search"
response = requests.post(
    url,
    data={
        "query_type": "text",
        "query_text": "A red sports car driving down the highway",
    },
)
data = response.json()
print(data)
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Playground

The deployment includes a playground web interface, hosted as an S3 static site.
The playground serves as an implementation example for the core features of the
Kubrick API.

### Ingestion

Users can upload videos into a private library, which will automatically create
an embedding task.

<video controls muted width="1000">
  <source src="/src/assets/demos/walkthrough/ingestion-walkthrough.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

**Steps:**

- From the initial page of the playground navigate to the embed page
- Upload 3-5 videos
- Navigate to the embedding tasks page
- Focus on the status changes for each of the embedding tasks

Video ideas:

- The video with the explosion
- Coding related
- Take on me video, so we can use it to search using a cover of the same song
- Video where the person was screaming
- Video in the store

Videos to be uploaded here:

- Location in the drive with the videos

### Text Queries

Text queries return relevant results even if they describe qualities that aren’t
concrete like emotion, tone, composition, visual style, and movement.

<video controls muted width="1000">
  <source src="/src/assets/demos/walkthrough/search-text-walkthrough.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

**Steps:**

- Starting from the search page
- Type “A person screaming”
- Show the first 2 matches

### Media Queries

Kubrick also enables querying with image, audio, and video files. Users can
upload a reference image to find visually similar scenes, search using an audio
clip to locate moments with matching soundscapes or music, or provide a video
segment to retrieve the most similar clips in the library.

#### Video/Audio
