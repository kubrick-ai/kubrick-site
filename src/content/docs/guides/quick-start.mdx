Get Kubrick deployed to AWS in minutes using our interactive CLI tool. The CLI
handles all the complex Terraform operations and guides you through the setup
process.

:::tip

The Kubrick CLI is the recommended way to deploy. For advanced users who need
direct Terraform control, see the [Manual Setup](/guides/manual-setup) guide.

:::

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

### Required Software

- **Terraform** (>= 1.0) -
  [Installation Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
- **AWS CLI** (>= 2.15.0) -
  [Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- **Python** (>= 3.13) - [Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **uv** -
  [Installation Guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- **Node.js** (>= 24.2.0) & **npm** (>= 11.4.2) -
  [Installation Guide](https://nodejs.org/)

### AWS Account Setup

- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials: `aws configure`

<details>
  <summary>Your AWS user/role needs these permissions:</summary>
  `AmazonS3FullAccess`, `AWSLambdaFullAccess`, `AmazonAPIGatewayAdministrator`,
  `CloudFrontFullAccess`, `AmazonSQSFullAccess`, `AmazonRDSFullAccess`
  ,`SecretsManagerReadWrite`, `IAMFullAccess`
</details>

### TwelveLabs API Key

- You will need a TwelveLabs API key. If you don't have one, you can get one
  [here](https://docs.twelvelabs.io/v1.3/docs/advanced/organizations/users-guide#create-api-keys)

## Installation and Deployment

<Steps>

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kubrick-ai/kubrick.git
   cd kubrick
   ```

2. **Build and Install the CLI**

   ```bash
   cd cli
   npm run build
   ```

   The CLI is now installed globally and available as `kubrick` within the root
   folder (You may need to restart your shell).

3. **Deploy Infrastructure**

   Run the interactive deployment:

   ```bash
   kubrick deploy
   ```

   The CLI will guide you through:
   - Building Lambda packages
   - AWS Profile and region selection
   - Database credentials setup
   - TwelveLabs API key configuration
   - Terraform deployment process

   Run `kubrick --help` for command options

4. **Wait for Deployment**

   Deployment typically takes 10-15 minutes. The CLI will show progress and any
   issues encountered.

</Steps>

## Testing Your Deployment

Once deployment completes successfully:

<Steps>

1. **Access the Playground**

   The CLI will provide you with the CloudFront URL for your deployed playground
   interface.

2. **Upload a Test Video**

   Use the playground interface to upload a video file and verify the ingestion
   pipeline works.

3. **Perform a Search**

   Try searching for content in your uploaded video using natural language
   queries.

</Steps>

:::tip[Playground Interface]

The playground provides a web interface to test video uploads and search
functionality. Use it to validate your deployment or as an example for API
integration.

:::

## What Gets Deployed

Your Kubrick deployment includes:

- **API Gateway** - RESTful API for video upload and search
- **AWS Lambda Functions** - Video processing and API endpoints
- **CloudFront Distribution** - Global content delivery for the playground
- **S3 Buckets** - Video storage and static assets
- **RDS PostgreSQL** - Database for video metadata, embeddings tasks, and vector
  embeddings (with `pgvector`).
- **SQS Queue** - Asynchronous processing pipeline
- **Secrets Manager** - Secure credential storage

## Teardown

To destroy your deployment, just type `kubrick destroy`.
